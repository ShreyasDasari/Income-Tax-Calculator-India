## How It Works

1. **Input Collection**: The program collects your annual salary and deductions
2. **Tax Calculation**: 
   - For Old Regime: Taxable Income = Salary - Deductions
   - For New Regime: Taxable Income = Salary (no deductions allowed)
3. **Progressive Taxation**: Tax is calculated progressively across slabs
4. **Cess Addition**: 4% cess is added to the base tax amount
5. **Comparison**: Both regimes are compared to recommend the better option

## Deductions Supported (Old Regime)

- Section 80C (‚Çπ1.5 Lakhs limit)
- Section 80D (Medical Insurance)
- HRA (House Rent Allowance)
- LTA (Leave Travel Allowance)
- Standard Deduction (‚Çπ50,000)
